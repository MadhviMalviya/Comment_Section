# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- task:This is an assignment to evaluate your technical abilities to fit in Ajjas.

Your challenge is to build an interactive comment section for a website using React. Each comment will have a score that is determined by the amount of Upvotes and Downvotes it receives. The user must be able to add new comments and reply to existing comments.

Note that all comments must be hierarchical. This means that each reply is treated as a separate comment and it can have its own set of replies.

The user should be able to:
View all comments and replies in a pleasant design.
Add new comments as well as reply to existing comments.
Upvote or Downvote all comments.
Sort all comments by time (Oldest First / Newest First), or by their scores (Most Score / Least Score).
Bonus: Filter the comment section by a selected user.
You are free to use any Design / Component Libraries (Bootstrap, Chakra UI, etc.), and IDE / Text Editor to help you complete this challenge. You are encouraged to ask as many questions as you want(if any) during this challenge.

You will be evaluated on the:
The functionality of the solution and the approach taken to solve it.
Time taken to complete the assignment.
Design and responsiveness of the result.
Structure, modularity, and readability of the code.

Time limit: 2 hours. -->
